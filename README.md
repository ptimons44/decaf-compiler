# Decaf Compiler written in Java

This repo is cloned from [MIT 6.1100 starter repo](https://github.com/6110-sp25/decaf-skeleton-java). It also contains the [public tests repo](https://github.com/6110-sp25/public-tests) as a submodule in test/public-tests.


This project by default uses Gradle with Kotlin DSL and Java 17.

__PSA to 6.1100 students__: If you decide to reference my work, please adhere to all course policies. Although I have no affiliation with MIT's 6.1100 class and did not take the class in my time at MIT, do not rope me into plaigarism violations! I would like to keep this personal project in my public portfolio without upsetting MIT staff.
