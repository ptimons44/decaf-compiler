__PSA to 6.1100 students__: If you decide to reference my work, please adhere to all course policies. Although I have no affiliation with MIT's 6.1100 class and did not take the class in my time at MIT, do not rope me into plaigarism violations! I would like to keep this personal project in my public portfolio without upsetting MIT staff.
